# Interactive Shed Designer
## Introduction

Sounds like a weird project right? Three.js is cool, but why would I care about sheds?

Well... I don't. This was once of those bad/good ideas when you say you'll start doing some work for someone, with the belief that they will eventually pay you for it. You guessed it - nobody paid for this... though it is cool, and I did learn from it!

## Who is the tool intended for?

Anyone who wants to prospect what their ideal shed looks like.

## What can you use the tool for?

To interactively change:
* Shed size
* Where to include windows
* Roof type
* Shed colour
* Roof material
